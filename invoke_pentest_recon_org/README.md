# invoke_pentest_recon_org

Script to recon domains, IPs and other assets for an organization.

There is a script available to find related higher level domains for an organization via `generate_seed.sh` and `generate_seed.cnf`

To further enumerate the subdomains for discovered in the seed, the `enum_subdomains.sh` script has been provided 

## Setup

### via docker

We leverage docker as follows to build the container:

```
docker build -t invoke_pentest_recon_org:latest .
```

Copy `generate_seed.cnf` file to `in_generate_seed.cnf` file and update the `WHOXY_API_KEY` in `in_generate_seed.cnf`. Update any other configuration settings as necessary in `in_generate_seed.cnf` file as well eg `OUTFILE`

Add any domains to be manually appended to the output `in_manual_domains.txt`

## Usage

Execute the command below to identify the seed domains. Replace `$COMPANY_NAMES` with the different names of the company (eg identified via `whois` recommendation) AND domains with the different domains for the company (eg identified as the main domains of the organization).

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/data -it invoke_pentest_recon_org:latest generate_seed.sh $COMPANY_NAMES $COMPANY_DOMAINS
```
